Last Updated: April 12, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Paste2Drive ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Chrome Extension ("Extension"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and personal information.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Google Account Information**: When you authenticate with Google, we receive basic profile information including your name, email address, and profile picture.
- **Google Drive Access**: The extension accesses your Google Drive to upload images and create folders.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Clipboard Data**: When you use the extension's functionality, it reads image data from your clipboard, but only when you explicitly trigger this action using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+V or Cmd+Shift+V) or context menu option.
- **Usage Data**: We collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the extension, such as which features are used most frequently.

### Storage

- **Extension Storage**: We store your preferences (like your default folder selection) locally in Chrome's extension storage. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Extension
- Enable you to upload images to your Google Drive
- Generate shareable links for uploaded images
- Save your preferences to improve your experience

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Your information may be shared in the following situations:

- **Google APIs**: When you use the Extension, your data is sent directly to Google APIs to perform the requested actions (e.g., uploading files to Google Drive).
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## Third-Party Services

This Extension interacts with Google services, particularly Google Drive. When you use our Extension, you are also subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review Google's privacy practices:
