# Privacy Policy for Paste2Drive

Last Updated: April 15, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Paste2Drive ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Chrome Extension ("Extension"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and personal information.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

- **Google Account Information**: When you authenticate with Google, we receive basic profile information including your name, email address, and profile picture.
- **Google Drive Access**: The extension accesses your Google Drive to upload images and create folders.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Clipboard Data**: When you use the extension's functionality, it reads image data from your clipboard, but only when you explicitly trigger this action using the extension popup or context menu option.

### Storage

- **Extension Storage**: We store your preferences (like your default folder selection) locally in Chrome's extension storage. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide the core functionality of the Extension
- Enable you to upload images to your Google Drive
- Generate shareable links for uploaded images
- Store your preferences locally to remember your selected default folder and settings

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Your information is only shared with Google's services when you explicitly use the Extension to upload files to Google Drive.

## Third-Party Services

This Extension interacts with Google services, particularly Google Drive. When you use our Extension, you are also subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review Google's privacy practices:

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## Your Rights and Choices

You can control your data in the following ways:

- **Google Account Access**: You can revoke the Extension's access to your Google account at any time by visiting [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
- **Extension Permissions**: You can review and modify the Extension's permissions in Chrome's extension settings.
- **Uninstallation**: You can uninstall the Extension at any time, which will remove all locally stored preferences.

## Data Security

The Extension is designed to interact directly between your browser and Google's services. No data is sent to or stored on our servers. All preference data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
